# Progress: Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Planning and Architecture

We have completed the initial architecture design and planning phase. The project is now ready to move into the implementation phase.

## What Works

1. **Architecture Design**: 
   - Completed system architecture with event-driven approach
   - Defined component interactions and data flow
   - Designed for scalability and resilience

2. **Technical Planning**:
   - Defined technology stack and dependencies
   - Created API contracts and data models
   - Established development approach and workflow

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive architecture document
   - Defined project requirements and constraints
   - Documented technical decisions and rationale

## What's Left to Build

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Initialize Nx workspace
   - Create package structure
   - Configure build and deployment

2. **Shared Package**:
   - Implement data models with Zod schemas
   - Create utility functions
   - Define event types

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Create CDK stack
   - Set up AWS resources
   - Configure deployment pipeline

4. **Backend Services**:
   - Implement API endpoints
   - Create database operations
   - Set up event processing

5. **Frontend Application**:
   - Create React components
   - Implement user interface
   - Set up API integration

6. **Integration and Testing**:
   - Deploy to AWS
   - Test end-to-end flow
   - Verify functionality

7. **Demo Preparation**:
   - Create test data
   - Prepare demonstration script
   - Document business value proposition

## Implementation Timeline

| Component | Estimated Time | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Project Setup | 1 hour | Not Started |
| Shared Package | 1 hour | Not Started |
| Infrastructure | 1.5 hours | Not Started |
| Backend Services | 2 hours | Not Started |
| Frontend Application | 1.5 hours | Not Started |
| Integration and Testing | 0.5 hour | Not Started |
| Demo Preparation | 0.5 hour | Not Started |

## Known Issues

No implementation issues at this time as we are still in the planning phase.

## Potential Challenges

1. **Time Constraints**:
   - The 1-day implementation timeframe is ambitious
   - Need to prioritize core functionality over nice-to-have features

2. **AWS Deployment**:
   - Initial deployment may require troubleshooting
   - Need to ensure proper IAM permissions and resource configurations

3. **OpenRouter Integration**:
   - API key management and security
   - Handling rate limits and potential service disruptions

4. **DynamoDB Streams**:
   - Proper configuration of stream processing
   - Handling potential duplicate events

5. **React Application**:
   - Balancing functionality with simplicity for the demo
   - Ensuring responsive design for presentation

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Initialize the Nx workspace with the required packages
2. Set up the shared package with data models and schemas
3. Create the CDK infrastructure stack
4. Begin implementing the backend services

## Success Metrics

The project will be considered successful when:

1. The end-to-end flow is working:
   - User data can be created and updated
   - Engagement scores are calculated correctly
   - Personalized emails are generated for at-risk users
   - Generated emails are displayed in the dashboard

2. The system is deployed to AWS and accessible for demonstration

3. The architecture demonstrates scalability and resilience principles

4. The business value proposition is clearly articulated and demonstrated
