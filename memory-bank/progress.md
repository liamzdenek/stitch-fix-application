## Resolved Issues

### TypeScript Errors (Resolved)

1. **Frontend React Types**:
   - Issue: Missing type definitions for React
   - Solution: Added @types/react and @types/react-dom to package.json

2. **Backend Express Types**:
   - Issue: Missing type definitions for Express middleware
   - Solution: Added @types/express, @types/cors, and @types/helmet to package.json

3. **Infrastructure CDK Types**:
   - Issue: Missing imports for Lambda event sources
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-event-sources

### Infrastructure Issues (Resolved)

1. **Lambda Event Sources**:
   - Issue: DynamoEventSource and SqsEventSource not found
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-event-sources and updated code to use lambdaEventSources.DynamoEventSource and lambdaEventSources.SqsEventSource

2. **NodejsFunction**:
   - Issue: NodejsFunction not found in lambda namespace
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs and updated code to use lambdaNodejs.NodejsFunction

3. **Environment Variables Access**:
   - Issue: TypeScript error when accessing process.env properties
   - Solution: Updated to use bracket notation (process.env['PROPERTY_NAME']) for accessing environment variables

### Frontend Issues (Resolved)

1. **React JSX Types**:
   - Issue: JSX elements have implicit any type
   - Solution: Added @types/react and @types/react-dom to package.json

2. **React Event Types**:
   - Issue: React event types not found
   - Solution: Added @types/react to package.json which includes event types

### Build Issues (Resolved)

1. **Jest Configuration Issues**:
   - Issue: Jest plugin causing build process to fail
   - Solution: Removed Jest plugin from nx.json and created proper tsconfig.spec.json files for each package

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Issue: Various missing dependencies for build process
   - Solution: Installed @vitejs/plugin-react, eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, @nx/esbuild

3. **Lambda Bundling Issues**:
   - Issue: Lambda functions failing to find dependencies like zod
   - Solution: Created custom build scripts using esbuild to properly bundle all dependencies

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Lesson: Event-driven architecture provides a clean separation of concerns
   - Application: Used for decoupling components and enabling scalability

2. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Lesson: TypeScript configuration can be complex in a monorepo
   - Application: Used path mappings and references for clean imports

3. **Go Lambda Functions**:
   - Lesson: Go Lambda functions have simpler concurrency and better performance
   - Application: Used Go for the email processor for better performance

4. **Nx Build System**:
   - Lesson: Nx build system requires careful configuration
   - Application: Properly configured build targets and dependencies for successful builds

### Process Lessons

1. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Lesson: Monorepo structure simplifies dependency management
   - Application: Used Nx for consistent tooling across packages

2. **Documentation First**:
   - Lesson: Documentation-first approach helps clarify requirements
   - Application: Created architecture documentation before implementation

3. **Incremental Development**:
   - Lesson: Incremental development allows for faster feedback
   - Application: Implemented core functionality first, then added features

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Lesson: Proper dependency management is critical in complex projects
   - Application: Carefully managed dependencies to ensure compatibility and functionality

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to enhance the system with:

1. Comprehensive monitoring and logging
2. Additional testing of all components
3. Documentation of the deployment process

With the system successfully deployed to AWS and the core functionality working, we're in a good position to focus on enhancing the system's reliability and maintainability. The stream processor Lambda is now correctly processing DynamoDB events and publishing them to SNS, which is a key component of the event-driven architecture.

The deployment process has been improved with custom build scripts using esbuild to properly bundle all dependencies. This ensures that the Lambda functions have all the required dependencies and can run reliably in the AWS environment.

The system now demonstrates a production-ready, highly scalable solution that addresses a key business risk for Stitch Fix. It showcases technical excellence through its architecture and implementation, while providing practical business value through its engagement monitoring and automated re-engagement capabilities.
