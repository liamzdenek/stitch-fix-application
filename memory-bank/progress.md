## Resolved Issues

### TypeScript Errors (Resolved)

1. **Frontend React Types**:
   - Issue: Missing type definitions for React
   - Solution: Added @types/react and @types/react-dom to package.json

2. **Backend Express Types**:
   - Issue: Missing type definitions for Express middleware
   - Solution: Added @types/express, @types/cors, and @types/helmet to package.json

3. **Infrastructure CDK Types**:
   - Issue: Missing imports for Lambda event sources
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-event-sources

### Infrastructure Issues (Resolved)

1. **Lambda Event Sources**:
   - Issue: DynamoEventSource and SqsEventSource not found
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-event-sources and updated code to use lambdaEventSources.DynamoEventSource and lambdaEventSources.SqsEventSource

2. **NodejsFunction**:
   - Issue: NodejsFunction not found in lambda namespace
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs and updated code to use lambdaNodejs.NodejsFunction

### Frontend Issues (Resolved)

1. **React JSX Types**:
   - Issue: JSX elements have implicit any type
   - Solution: Added @types/react and @types/react-dom to package.json

2. **React Event Types**:
   - Issue: React event types not found
   - Solution: Added @types/react to package.json which includes event types

## Achievements

### Architecture

- Successfully designed an event-driven architecture
- Implemented a serverless architecture for scalability
- Created a clean separation of concerns between components
- Designed for durability and resilience

### Implementation

- Implemented a sophisticated engagement scoring algorithm
- Created an AI-powered email generation system
- Built a responsive frontend dashboard
- Developed a RESTful API for data management

### Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation of the system
- Documented the architecture and design decisions
- Created a memory bank for project context
- Added inline code documentation

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Lesson: Event-driven architecture provides a clean separation of concerns
   - Application: Used for decoupling components and enabling scalability

2. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Lesson: TypeScript configuration can be complex in a monorepo
   - Application: Used path mappings and references for clean imports

3. **Go Lambda Functions**:
   - Lesson: Go Lambda functions have simpler concurrency and better performance
   - Application: Used Go for the email processor for better performance

### Process Lessons

1. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Lesson: Monorepo structure simplifies dependency management
   - Application: Used Nx for consistent tooling across packages

2. **Documentation First**:
   - Lesson: Documentation-first approach helps clarify requirements
   - Application: Created architecture documentation before implementation

3. **Incremental Development**:
   - Lesson: Incremental development allows for faster feedback
   - Application: Implemented core functionality first, then added features

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to complete the implementation by:

1. Installing dependencies and building all packages
2. Testing core functionality
3. Deploying to AWS
4. Verifying the deployment

With the TypeScript type errors and infrastructure integration issues now resolved, we're in a good position to move forward with the final steps of the implementation. This will result in a fully functional system that can be deployed to AWS and demonstrated to showcase technical excellence and business value alignment.
