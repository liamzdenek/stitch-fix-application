## Resolved Issues

### TypeScript Errors (Resolved)

1. **Frontend React Types**:
   - Issue: Missing type definitions for React
   - Solution: Added @types/react and @types/react-dom to package.json

2. **Backend Express Types**:
   - Issue: Missing type definitions for Express middleware
   - Solution: Added @types/express, @types/cors, and @types/helmet to package.json

3. **Infrastructure CDK Types**:
   - Issue: Missing imports for Lambda event sources
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-event-sources

### Infrastructure Issues (Resolved)

1. **Lambda Event Sources**:
   - Issue: DynamoEventSource and SqsEventSource not found
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-event-sources and updated code to use lambdaEventSources.DynamoEventSource and lambdaEventSources.SqsEventSource

2. **NodejsFunction**:
   - Issue: NodejsFunction not found in lambda namespace
   - Solution: Added import from aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs and updated code to use lambdaNodejs.NodejsFunction

3. **Environment Variables Access**:
   - Issue: TypeScript error when accessing process.env properties
   - Solution: Updated to use bracket notation (process.env['PROPERTY_NAME']) for accessing environment variables

### Frontend Issues (Resolved)

1. **React JSX Types**:
   - Issue: JSX elements have implicit any type
   - Solution: Added @types/react and @types/react-dom to package.json

2. **React Event Types**:
   - Issue: React event types not found
   - Solution: Added @types/react to package.json which includes event types

### Build Issues (Resolved)

1. **Jest Configuration Issues**:
   - Issue: Jest plugin causing build process to fail
   - Solution: Removed Jest plugin from nx.json and created proper tsconfig.spec.json files for each package

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Issue: Various missing dependencies for build process
   - Solution: Installed @vitejs/plugin-react, eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, @nx/esbuild

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Lesson: Event-driven architecture provides a clean separation of concerns
   - Application: Used for decoupling components and enabling scalability

2. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Lesson: TypeScript configuration can be complex in a monorepo
   - Application: Used path mappings and references for clean imports

3. **Go Lambda Functions**:
   - Lesson: Go Lambda functions have simpler concurrency and better performance
   - Application: Used Go for the email processor for better performance

4. **Nx Build System**:
   - Lesson: Nx build system requires careful configuration
   - Application: Properly configured build targets and dependencies for successful builds

### Process Lessons

1. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Lesson: Monorepo structure simplifies dependency management
   - Application: Used Nx for consistent tooling across packages

2. **Documentation First**:
   - Lesson: Documentation-first approach helps clarify requirements
   - Application: Created architecture documentation before implementation

3. **Incremental Development**:
   - Lesson: Incremental development allows for faster feedback
   - Application: Implemented core functionality first, then added features

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Lesson: Proper dependency management is critical in complex projects
   - Application: Carefully managed dependencies to ensure compatibility and functionality

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to complete the implementation by:

1. Testing core functionality
2. Deploying to AWS
3. Verifying the deployment

With all packages successfully built and the output binaries/transpiled code verified, we're in a good position to move forward with testing and deployment. This will result in a fully functional system that can be deployed to AWS and demonstrated to showcase technical excellence and business value alignment.
