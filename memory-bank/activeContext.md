# Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System - Active Context

## Current Focus

The Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System is a 1-day demo project designed to showcase technical excellence and business value alignment for a job application to Stitch Fix. The system addresses a key risk identified in Stitch Fix's annual SEC report: client retention and engagement.

The current focus is on implementing a production-ready, highly scalable solution that demonstrates a balance of technical excellence and practical business value. The system is designed to monitor client engagement, identify clients at risk of disengagement, and automatically generate personalized emails to re-engage them.

1. **Shared Package**:
   - Data models for users, emails, and orders
   - Zod schemas for validation
   - Event types and utilities
   - Engagement score calculation algorithm

2. **Stream Processor**:
   - Lambda function for processing DynamoDB stream events
   - Event publishing to SNS

3. **Email Processor (Go)**:
   - Lambda function for processing events from SQS
   - Engagement score calculation
   - Email generation using OpenAI
   - Email sending via SES

4. **Backend API**:
   - Express.js API for managing users and emails
   - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations

5. **Frontend UI**:
   - React application for monitoring user engagement
   - Dashboard for viewing users and emails
   - Form for adding new users

6. **Infrastructure**:
   - AWS CDK stack for defining AWS resources
   - DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions, SNS/SQS, S3/CloudFront

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

   - Rationale: Reduces operational overhead and provides automatic scaling
   - Status: Implemented

3. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Decision: Organize code in an Nx monorepo
   - Rationale: Provides consistent tooling and simplifies dependency management
   - Status: Implemented

### Technical Decisions

1. **TypeScript for Most Components**:
   - Decision: Use TypeScript for frontend, backend, and infrastructure
   - Rationale: Provides type safety and better developer experience
   - Status: Implemented

2. **Go for Email Processor**:
   - Decision: Use Go for the email processor
   - Rationale: Provides better performance and simpler concurrency
   - Status: Implemented

3. **DynamoDB for Data Storage**:
   - Decision: Use DynamoDB for data storage
   - Rationale: Provides automatic scaling and built-in streams
   - Status: Implemented

4. **SNS/SQS for Messaging**:
   - Decision: Use SNS and SQS for messaging
   - Rationale: Provides durability and rate control
   - Status: Implemented

### Implementation Decisions

1. **Engagement Score Algorithm**:
   - Decision: Implement a scoring algorithm based on order recency, frequency, and value
   - Rationale: Provides a quantitative measure of engagement risk
   - Status: Implemented

2. **Email Generation**:
   - Decision: Use OpenAI for generating personalized email content
   - Rationale: Provides high-quality, personalized content
   - Status: Implemented

3. **Frontend Dashboard**:
   - Decision: Implement a simple dashboard for monitoring engagement
   - Rationale: Provides visibility into engagement metrics
   - Status: Implemented

## Current Challenges

1. **TypeScript Type Errors**:
   - Challenge: TypeScript type errors in the frontend and backend
   - Status: Need to install type definitions for dependencies

2. **Infrastructure Integration**:
   - Challenge: Integrating Lambda event sources in CDK
   - Status: Need to import correct modules

3. **Testing**:
   - Challenge: Limited time for comprehensive testing
   - Status: Focus on core functionality testing

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Type Errors**:
   - Install missing type definitions
   - Resolve TypeScript errors

2. **Complete Infrastructure**:
   - Fix CDK import issues
   - Ensure all resources are properly defined

3. **Documentation**:
   - Complete README
   - Document architecture and implementation details

4. **Testing**:
   - Test core functionality
   - Verify end-to-end flow

5. **Deployment**:
   - Prepare for deployment to AWS
   - Document deployment process

## Open Questions

1. **OpenAI API Key Management**:
   - Question: How to securely manage the OpenAI API key in production?
   - Options: AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables, parameter store
   - Current approach: Environment variables for demo

2. **Email Sending Limits**:
   - Question: How to handle SES sending limits in production?
   - Options: Request sending limit increase, implement rate limiting
   - Current approach: Assume sufficient limits for demo

3. **Frontend Hosting**:
   - Question: How to handle frontend routing with S3/CloudFront?
   - Options: Configure error document, use Lambda@Edge
   - Current approach: Configure error document to index.html

## Key Insights

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Insight: Event-driven architecture provides a clean separation of concerns
   - Application: Used for decoupling components and enabling scalability

2. **Engagement Scoring**:
   - Insight: Quantitative scoring enables automated decision-making
   - Application: Used for identifying at-risk clients

3. **Personalization**:
   - Insight: AI-generated content can be highly personalized
   - Application: Used for creating engaging email content

## Current Status

The system is currently in the final stages of implementation. All core components have been implemented, but there are still some TypeScript type errors and infrastructure integration issues to resolve. The next steps are to fix these issues, complete the documentation, and prepare for deployment.

The system demonstrates a production-ready, highly scalable solution that addresses a key business risk for Stitch Fix. It showcases technical excellence through its architecture and implementation, while providing practical business value through its engagement monitoring and automated re-engagement capabilities.
