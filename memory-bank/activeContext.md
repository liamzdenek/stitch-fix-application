# Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System - Active Context

## Current Focus

The Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System is a 1-day demo project designed to showcase technical excellence and business value alignment for a job application to Stitch Fix. The system addresses a key risk identified in Stitch Fix's annual SEC report: client retention and engagement.

The current focus is on implementing a production-ready, highly scalable solution that demonstrates a balance of technical excellence and practical business value. The system is designed to monitor client engagement, identify clients at risk of disengagement, and automatically generate personalized emails to re-engage them.

## Current Status

The system is now successfully deployed to AWS with all components working correctly. All core components have been implemented, the TypeScript type errors and infrastructure integration issues have been resolved, and all dependencies have been successfully installed. The project is now properly set up as an Nx monorepo with all the necessary dependencies and correct imports.

All packages have been successfully built with proper bundling of dependencies and deployed to AWS. The shared package, stream processor, backend API, frontend UI, infrastructure, and email processor (Go) are all built and deployed.

The stream processor Lambda is now correctly processing DynamoDB events and publishing them to SNS. The email processor Lambda is receiving events from SQS and processing them correctly. We've verified this by adding test users to the DynamoDB table and checking the CloudWatch logs, which show successful event processing.

The deployment process has been improved with custom build scripts using esbuild to properly bundle all dependencies. The Nx build system has been configured with proper dependencies between packages to ensure reliable builds and deployments. We've also implemented a secure deployment process using environment variables for API keys.

The system demonstrates a production-ready, highly scalable solution that addresses a key business risk for Stitch Fix. It showcases technical excellence through its architecture and implementation, while providing practical business value through its engagement monitoring and automated re-engagement capabilities.
