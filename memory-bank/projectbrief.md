# Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System is a 1-day demo project designed to showcase technical excellence and business value alignment for a job application to Stitch Fix. The system addresses a key risk identified in Stitch Fix's annual SEC report: client retention and engagement.

## Core Requirements

1. **Production-Ready**: The system must be designed with production-quality code, architecture, and practices.
2. **Highly Scalable**: The system must be able to scale to handle Stitch Fix's customer base.
3. **Business Value Alignment**: The system must directly address business risks identified in Stitch Fix's SEC report.
4. **Technical Excellence**: The system must demonstrate strong technical skills and best practices.
5. **Completable in 1 Day**: The system must be scoped to be implementable within a 1-day timeframe.

## Key Features

1. **Engagement Monitoring**: Track client engagement through a sophisticated scoring algorithm.
2. **Risk Identification**: Identify clients at risk of disengagement based on engagement scores.
3. **Automated Re-engagement**: Generate personalized emails to re-engage at-risk clients.
4. **Effectiveness Tracking**: Monitor the effectiveness of re-engagement efforts.
5. **Management Dashboard**: Provide a UI for monitoring and managing client engagement.

## Technical Requirements

1. **12-Factor App**: Implement a 12-Factor app design for cloud-native deployment.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use an event-driven architecture for scalability and resilience.
3. **AWS Infrastructure**: Design for deployment on AWS using serverless components where appropriate.
4. **Nx Monorepo**: Organize code in an Nx monorepo with multiple packages.
5. **TypeScript & Go**: Use TypeScript for frontend and most backend components, with Go for the email processor.
6. **React Frontend**: Implement a React-based frontend for the management dashboard.
7. **DynamoDB**: Use DynamoDB for data storage with streams for event generation.
8. **SNS/SQS**: Use SNS and SQS for reliable message delivery.
9. **OpenAI Integration**: Use OpenAI for generating personalized email content.

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- User data management
- Engagement scoring algorithm
- Email generation and sending
- Management dashboard
- AWS infrastructure definition

### Out of Scope

- Authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive testing
- CI/CD pipeline
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Multi-region deployment

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional System**: A working end-to-end system that demonstrates all key features.
2. **Clean Architecture**: A well-designed architecture that follows best practices.
3. **Quality Code**: Clean, maintainable code that follows best practices.
4. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of the system architecture and functionality.
5. **Deployment Ready**: Infrastructure code that could be deployed to AWS with minimal changes.

## Timeline

This is a 1-day project with the following high-level timeline:

1. **Planning & Architecture** (1 hour): Define the system architecture and component interactions.
2. **Core Implementation** (6 hours): Implement the core components of the system.
3. **UI Implementation** (2 hours): Implement the management dashboard.
4. **Documentation** (1 hour): Document the system architecture and functionality.
5. **Final Review** (1 hour): Review the system and make any final adjustments.

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**: Complete source code for all components.
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the system architecture.
3. **README**: Instructions for building, running, and deploying the system.
4. **Demo**: A working demo of the system.

## Project Constraints

1. **Time**: The project must be completable within 1 day.
2. **Complexity**: The system must be complex enough to demonstrate technical excellence but simple enough to complete in 1 day.
3. **Dependencies**: The system should minimize external dependencies to reduce complexity.
4. **Scope**: The system must focus on the core features and avoid scope creep.

## Stakeholders

1. **Hiring Manager**: The primary audience for the project.
2. **Technical Interviewers**: Engineers who will evaluate the technical aspects of the project.
3. **Business Stakeholders**: Individuals who will evaluate the business value alignment.

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Time Constraint**: Risk of not completing the project within 1 day.
   - Mitigation: Carefully scope the project and focus on core features.

2. **Technical Complexity**: Risk of over-engineering the solution.
   - Mitigation: Keep the design simple while demonstrating best practices.

3. **Integration Challenges**: Risk of integration issues between components.
   - Mitigation: Use well-defined interfaces and event-driven communication.

4. **AWS Configuration**: Risk of complex AWS setup.
   - Mitigation: Use CDK for infrastructure as code and focus on key components.

## Conclusion

This project brief outlines the requirements, scope, and constraints for the Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System. The project aims to demonstrate technical excellence and business value alignment through a production-ready, highly scalable solution that addresses a key business risk for Stitch Fix.
