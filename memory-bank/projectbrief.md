# Project Brief: Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System

## Overview

This 1-day demo project is designed as a job application for Stitch Fix, demonstrating technical excellence and business value by addressing a key risk identified in Stitch Fix's SEC report: "We may be unable to retain clients or maintain a high level of engagement with our clients."

## Core Requirements

1. Create a production-ready, highly scalable solution that identifies at-risk customers and delivers personalized re-engagement emails
2. Implement an event-driven architecture using AWS services
3. Leverage an LLM (OpenRouter) to generate personalized email content
4. Provide a user interface for managing users and viewing generated emails
5. Complete the implementation within a 1-day timeframe

## Goals

1. **Technical Excellence**: Demonstrate expertise in cloud architecture, event-driven systems, and modern development practices
2. **Business Value**: Address a critical business risk with a solution that could drive measurable ROI
3. **Production Readiness**: Build a system that follows best practices and could be deployed to production
4. **Scalability**: Design for high throughput and reliability
5. **Maintainability**: Follow clean code practices and provide comprehensive documentation

## Constraints

1. 1-day implementation timeframe
2. Focus on demonstrating capabilities rather than building a complete product
3. Use actual AWS deployments for testing, no local development mocks

## Success Criteria

1. A working end-to-end system that can:
   - Manage user data
   - Identify at-risk customers based on engagement metrics
   - Generate personalized emails using an LLM
   - Display generated emails in a dashboard

2. A comprehensive architecture document explaining:
   - System design and components
   - Data flow and event processing
   - Scaling and reliability considerations
   - Deployment strategy

3. A compelling demo that showcases:
   - The technical implementation
   - The business value proposition
   - How the solution addresses Stitch Fix's key risk
