# Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System - System Patterns

## Architecture Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

The system follows an event-driven architecture pattern, where changes to user data trigger events that flow through the system. This pattern provides:

- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate through events, reducing direct dependencies.
- **Scalability**: Components can scale independently based on event volume.
- **Resilience**: Failure in one component doesn't affect others directly.
- **Extensibility**: New components can be added to consume events without modifying existing ones.

The event flow is:
1. User data changes in DynamoDB
2. DynamoDB Stream generates an event
3. Stream Processor Lambda processes the event
4. Event is published to SNS topic
5. SNS delivers the event to SQS queue
6. Email Processor Lambda consumes the event from SQS

### Microservices Architecture

The system is organized as a collection of loosely coupled services, each with a specific responsibility:

- **Shared Package**: Common types and utilities
- **Stream Processor**: Processes DynamoDB streams and publishes events
- **Email Processor**: Generates and sends personalized emails
- **Backend API**: Provides RESTful API for managing users and emails
- **Frontend UI**: User interface for monitoring and management

This pattern provides:
- **Modularity**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies (e.g., TypeScript vs. Go).
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own different services.
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures are contained within service boundaries.

### Serverless Architecture

The system leverages serverless components for compute:

- **Lambda Functions**: For event processing and API handling
- **DynamoDB**: For serverless database storage
- **SNS/SQS**: For serverless messaging
- **S3/CloudFront**: For serverless frontend hosting

This pattern provides:
- **Automatic Scaling**: Resources scale automatically with demand.
- **Pay-per-Use**: Costs are directly tied to usage.
- **Reduced Operational Overhead**: No servers to manage.
- **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy and fault tolerance.

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

The system uses the repository pattern to abstract data access:

- **Data Models**: Defined in the shared package
- **Data Access**: Encapsulated in repository functions
- **Business Logic**: Separated from data access concerns

This pattern provides:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from data access.
- **Testability**: Data access can be mocked for testing.
- **Flexibility**: The underlying data store can be changed without affecting business logic.

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

The system separates read and write operations:

- **Commands**: Operations that change state (create/update users, generate emails)
- **Queries**: Operations that read state (get users, get emails)

This pattern provides:
- **Scalability**: Read and write operations can be scaled independently.
- **Performance**: Read models can be optimized for query performance.
- **Flexibility**: Different data models can be used for reads and writes.

### Factory Pattern

The system uses factory functions to create complex objects:

- **Event Creation**: Factory function for creating events
- **Email Generation**: Factory function for generating emails
- **API Response Creation**: Factory function for creating API responses

This pattern provides:
- **Encapsulation**: Object creation logic is encapsulated.
- **Consistency**: Objects are created consistently.
- **Testability**: Object creation can be mocked for testing.

### Observer Pattern

The system uses the observer pattern for event handling:

- **Publishers**: Components that generate events (Stream Processor)
- **Subscribers**: Components that consume events (Email Processor)
- **Event Bus**: SNS/SQS for event delivery

This pattern provides:
- **Loose Coupling**: Publishers don't know about subscribers.
- **Scalability**: Multiple subscribers can consume the same events.
- **Extensibility**: New subscribers can be added without modifying publishers.

## Code Patterns

### Dependency Injection

The system uses dependency injection for managing dependencies:

- **Service Dependencies**: Injected into components that need them
- **Configuration**: Injected via environment variables
- **External Clients**: Injected into services that use them

This pattern provides:
- **Testability**: Dependencies can be mocked for testing.
- **Flexibility**: Dependencies can be changed without modifying consumers.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Components focus on their core responsibilities.

### Functional Programming

The system uses functional programming principles where appropriate:

- **Pure Functions**: Functions without side effects
- **Immutability**: Data is treated as immutable
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take or return functions

This pattern provides:
- **Predictability**: Pure functions are easier to reason about.
- **Testability**: Pure functions are easier to test.
- **Concurrency**: Immutable data is safer for concurrent operations.

### Error Handling

The system follows consistent error handling patterns:

- **Error Types**: Well-defined error types
- **Error Propagation**: Errors are propagated up the call stack
- **Error Logging**: Errors are logged with context
- **Error Responses**: Consistent error responses from APIs

This pattern provides:
- **Reliability**: Errors are handled consistently.
- **Observability**: Errors are logged with context for debugging.
- **User Experience**: Users receive consistent error messages.

## Data Patterns

### Event Sourcing

The system uses event sourcing for tracking changes:

- **Events**: Represent changes to the system state
- **Event Store**: SNS/SQS for event delivery
- **Event Consumers**: Process events to update state

This pattern provides:
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are recorded as events.
- **Temporal Queries**: State can be reconstructed at any point in time.
- **Event Replay**: Events can be replayed to rebuild state.

### Materialized View

The system uses materialized views for efficient queries:

- **DynamoDB Tables**: Store the current state
- **GSIs**: Provide efficient access patterns
- **Event Processors**: Update materialized views based on events

This pattern provides:
- **Query Performance**: Queries are performed against pre-computed views.
- **Scalability**: Views can be optimized for specific query patterns.
- **Flexibility**: Different views can be created for different query needs.

## Integration Patterns

### Message Queue

The system uses message queues for reliable communication:

- **SNS**: For publishing events
- **SQS**: For buffering events
- **Lambda**: For consuming events

This pattern provides:
- **Decoupling**: Publishers and consumers are decoupled.
- **Buffering**: Messages are buffered during traffic spikes.
- **Reliability**: Messages are delivered at least once.
- **Scalability**: Multiple consumers can process messages in parallel.

### API Gateway

The system uses API Gateway for API management:

- **RESTful API**: For managing users and emails
- **Authentication**: For securing API access
- **Rate Limiting**: For protecting against abuse

This pattern provides:
- **Security**: APIs are secured with authentication and authorization.
- **Monitoring**: API usage is monitored and logged.
- **Rate Limiting**: APIs are protected against abuse.
- **Documentation**: APIs are documented with OpenAPI.

## Deployment Patterns

### Infrastructure as Code

The system uses Infrastructure as Code for deployment:

- **AWS CDK**: For defining AWS resources
- **TypeScript**: For writing infrastructure code
- **Stack**: For organizing related resources

This pattern provides:
- **Reproducibility**: Infrastructure can be recreated consistently.
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes are tracked in version control.
- **Automation**: Deployment can be automated with CI/CD.
- **Documentation**: Infrastructure is self-documenting.

### Blue-Green Deployment

The system supports blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates:

- **CloudFront**: For routing traffic between environments
- **S3**: For hosting multiple versions of the frontend
- **Lambda**: For versioning backend functions

This pattern provides:
- **Zero Downtime**: Updates can be deployed without downtime.
- **Rollback**: Failed deployments can be rolled back quickly.
- **Testing**: New versions can be tested in production-like environments.
- **Gradual Rollout**: Traffic can be shifted gradually to new versions.

## Conclusion

These system patterns form the foundation of the Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System. They provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture that can evolve over time to meet changing business needs.
