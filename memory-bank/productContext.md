# Stitch Fix Client Engagement Acceleration System - Product Context

## Business Context

Stitch Fix is a personalized styling service that combines human expertise with AI to deliver curated clothing selections to customers. The company operates on a subscription model where clients receive regular "fixes" (boxes of clothing items) based on their preferences, feedback, and style profile.

According to Stitch Fix's annual SEC report, one of the key risks to their business is client retention and engagement:

> "We may be unable to retain clients or maintain a high level of engagement with our clients and maintain or increase their spending with us, which could harm our business, financial condition, or operating results."

This risk is particularly significant because:

1. **Customer Acquisition Cost**: Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.
2. **Lifetime Value**: Engaged customers have higher lifetime value through repeat purchases.
3. **Revenue Predictability**: Subscription-based businesses rely on predictable recurring revenue.
4. **Word-of-Mouth Marketing**: Engaged customers are more likely to refer new customers.

## Problem Statement

Stitch Fix needs a system to proactively identify clients at risk of disengagement and automatically take action to re-engage them before they churn. The current challenges include:

1. **Reactive Approach**: Current systems may only identify disengagement after it has occurred.
2. **Manual Intervention**: Re-engagement efforts may require manual intervention, limiting scalability.
3. **Generic Communication**: Re-engagement communications may not be sufficiently personalized.
4. **Limited Visibility**: Lack of comprehensive visibility into engagement metrics and trends.
